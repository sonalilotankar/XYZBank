# XYZ Bank
This is the automation repository for XYZ Bank - Demo Testing Site.

This framework is a hybrid framework using selenium with java, utilizing both Data-Driven and TestNG approaches.

For reporting, I have used Allure.
For logging, I have used Log4j.

Tools:
IntelliJ

To fetch Allure reports, run the following command:
Allure serve <folder Name>

Note: make sure your path should not have any space while running allure command.
Allure results stored in documents folder for the reference.
